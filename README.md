# TK-mid-ros2

## 1. Environment confirmation:
####      1.1. System:
            Ubuntu 22.04
####      1.2. ROS version:
            Humble

## 2.Computer and Industrial PC Boot Configuration
####      2.1. ensure rc.local file:
    2.1.1. rc.local File Verification and Setup
        Check if the rc.local file exists in the /etc/ directory:
    2.1.2. If not present, execute:
                 sudo cp rc.local /etc  
    2.1.3. If present, insert the following content above the exit 0 line in the rc.local file, then save:
                 sleep 2  
                 sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000  
                 sudo ip link set can0 up        
####      2.2. Pre-Boot CAN Card Connection Verification​
　　Ensure the CAN card is physically connected to the USB port of the industrial PC prior to system startup or reboot.      
####      2.3. Configuration Success Indication​
　　A successful setup is confirmed when both the RX (Receive) and TX (Transmit) indicators illuminate, validating proper communication establishment.

### 3.The subsequent section will address the process of establishing a connection between the CAN card and the system.
####      3.1. Chassis CAN card connection:
    Specifically, Chassis CAN-H is to be connected to CANH of the CAN card connector plug, while Chassis CAN-L is to be connected to CANL of the CAN card connector plug.
    The following diagram illustrates the recommended configuration:

####      3.2. Computer and robot communication connection:
    Subsequent to the completion of the aforementioned connection, the USB end of the CAN card cable should be inserted directly into the computer's USB port, thereby establishing a connection between the CAN card and the computer. Upon completion of the connection, the PWR light will illuminate.
####      3.3. Methodology for checking the success of USB connection:
    To initiate this process, one must access the terminal and enter the command: 
            lsusb
    If the output information displays content resembling that depicted in the following image, it can be deduced that CAN can be utilized without issue.

![](https://github.com/YUHESEN-Robot/TK-mid-ros2/blob/main/images/terminal_state.png?raw=true)

####      3.4. Communication initiation:
    To initiate this process, it is necessary to open a new terminal and enter the following commands: 
            sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 500000 & sudo ip link set can0 up
    If the chassis is in the power-up state, the blue RX light will blink, and the red TX light will be on at the same time.The blinking of the RX light indicates that the Can0 card receives data, and the blinking of the TX light indicates that it sends data.

## 4. Communication Data Viewing
####      4.1 To install the can-utils tool, the following command should be executed:
            sudo apt-get install can-utils
####      4.2 View data command:
            candump can0
####      4.3. Terminal print the information normally:

## 5. ROS2 program operation
####      5.1. File structure:

![](https://github.com/YUHESEN-Robot/TK-mid-ros2/blob/main/images/doc_tree.png?raw=true)

####      5.2.Compile workspace:  
    Open the terminal in your workspace/enter your workspace in the terminal, let the terminal be in the workspace level, then execute the command: 
            colcon build
            
####      5.3.Setting temporary environment variables:
    Execute the command in the terminal where you want to run the program:  
            source ~/your workspace (example: 5.1-ros2_ws)/install/setup.bash  
    Or, to keep the terminal where you want to run the program at the workspace level, execute the command:    
            source install/setup.bash  

![](https://github.com/YUHESEN-Robot/TK-mid-ros2/blob/main/images/source.png?raw=true)

####      5.4. Run:  
    Execute the following command, in the terminal where you have just entered the temporary environment variable. 
            ros2 launch yhs_can_control yhs_can_control.launch.py   
####      5.5. The terminal prints out a successful run message:  
![](https://github.com/YUHESEN-Robot/TK-mid-ros2/blob/main/images/node_print.png?raw=true)

## 6. Motion Test:
####      6.1. Before testing, it is recommended to lift the chassis or send a minimal speed command to the chassis (e.g., 0.03).
####      6.2. Open a new terminal, navigate to your workspace directory (e.g., 5.1-ros2_ws), and execute:
            source install/setup.bash
    OR (without entering the workspace directory):
            source ~/your workspace (example: 5.1-ros2_ws)/install/setup.bash
####      6.5. Send motion commands to control the chassis:
    6.5.1. Open a new terminal, navigate to your workspace directory, and set temporary environment variables:
            source install/setup.bash
    OR (without entering the workspace directory):
            source ~/your workspace(example: 5.1-ros2_ws)/install/setup.bash
    6.5.2. In a terminal with temporary environment variables configured, execute the rqt_publisher tool and ensure the remote controller is switched to command control mode.
            ros2 run rqt_publisher rqt_publisher
